## A restaurant app

I was inspirired to do this project when I first started learning flask. 
I have the basic stuff working; I can fetch food items and their corresponding images from the app's database. 

## Why Raj

I am open to suggestions. 
Ideas for a coupons page and a blog are also plausible. 
I thought I could use the app's database for blog articles as well but worried it would be doing too much. 

It doesn't hurt to try though. It would also be fun experienting with another framwework, possibly nodejs, with regards to building a working blog.

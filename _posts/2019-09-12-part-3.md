Last time we connected a database to our app, and how to add records. We also added a backend interface to our app to allow owners to add and remove records. We configured various flask extensions and added some `CSS` styling to our `HTML` templates. Today we're going to be looking at; managing users, adding a cart and implementing a checkout process.

## Objectives;

1. User management
2. Better frontend
3. Restricting access to owners
4. Creating a checkout process
5. `Experimenting`

## To be continued...

Happy coding. ðŸ™‚

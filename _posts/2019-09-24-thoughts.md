This isn't a rant. These are simply my thoughts on how you can become a better programmer. <br /> We all have goals, implicit or explicit that we strive to achieve. <br/>
Sometimes we succeed, and other times we fall, we `fail`. <br /> And as with all things in life, it is important to learn from your mistakes.<br/>
Becoming a better programmer is a balancing act between the 
abstract and the conrete parts of you as a programmer. 
Too much into one end and your stuck hunting down an invisible bug to the ends of the earth. 

# Balance better

My tips on how to strike that balance;
1. Know where you are and I'm not talking about physical space.
2. Do not waste time, every step should help you ascend, regardless of planning. For example;
    1. Do not dwell on mundane tasks, automate them out of the way fast.
3. Exercise your fingers, your body, and your mind regularly.
4. Learn how to learn.


I hope you find my list helpful/useful until then, happy coding.

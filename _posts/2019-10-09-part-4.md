<h1 class="text-center">Hello once again!</h1>
It's been a while since we last saw each other. Ha ha. Check out that front look! Those are some gorgeous images! Anyway, I've got some exciting news but first, lets recap or catch-up. <br />

In part 3 of this series, we saw how to manage users for our app. Specifically we looked into how to create users, blueprints and admins to add backend content to our app. We also experimented a bit with various styles. <br/> The app looks pretty neat on the desktop as well as on mobile screens. 

Now the exciting stuff;

1. Managing credentials for development purposes
2. `Migrations`, `migrations`, `migrations`
3. Adding `yummy` food images to our app
4. `Checkout!` comes to our app
5. ~~Creating a `blog` `Blueprint`~~ part 5

Your app should look gorgeous by the end of this post.

## Managing credentials for development

In [part 2]({% post_url 2019-09-10-part-2 %}) I suggested we use pydotenv to manage our app secrets, things like the `database` `password` and so on;

```python
import pydotenv
env = pydotenv.Environment()
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:'+env['DB_PASSWORD']+'@localhost:5432/raj_db'
```

However, there was a problem, my app was not connecting to my database - `raj_db`. 
I openned up a python shell to test the `pydotenv` package and sure enough it didn't work for mypassword. <br /> I had a number of options;

1. Change my database password to one that works with pydotenv.
2. Fork `pydotenv` and fix and use it instead of the original one.

I opted to go with option 2.<br />
So I headed over to the `git` repository of the `pydotenv` package to find our why my password was being split. <br /> This is what I found;

![img](/assets/img/pexels/problem.png)

This is the function that parses each line from the `.env` file. The code for the parser is wrong! <br /> That is if your password contains the `#` symbol. <br />
Secondly, the author doesn't warn users about this shortcoming. If you're stuck here it's better to add a comment stating that the parser does not work for passwords containing the `#` symbol. <br>

The solution to me was obvious, replace the `#` with a single space. 

![img](/assets/img/pexels/solution.png)

Of course I had to `fork` the original project to do this since the project itself appears to be abandoned. I commited my changes and pushed the fix to my `fork` of `pydotenv`. I didn't really have time to do a pull request because I didn't think my fix was robust enough for people whose passwords might contain spaces.

### Incorporating our solution

After testing that the fix worked, it was time to import my own version of `pydotenv`. 
I did this by generating a `requirements.txt` file;`(pyenv) pip freeze -r > requirements.txt`
Then I opened `requirements.txt` and replaced `pydotenv` with  `git+https://github.com/lehbyte/pydotenv.git#egg=pydotenv`

Finally, I then ran; `(pyenv) pip install -r requirements.txt` and my app was finally able to connect to my database `raj.db`. 

Of course all of this would have been done by simply navigating to the `pydotenv` package within my `virtualenv` `pyenv` and applying the fix there but then I wouldn't be able to do a pull request and you wouldn't be able to download my fix to use. `:(`

### Modifying `config.py`
Ok since `pydotenv` works, it's time to update our `config.py`;

```python
import os
import pydotenv
env = pydotenv.Environment()
basedir = os.path.abspath(os.dirname(__file__))

FLASK_ADMIN_SWATCH = 'cerulean'
TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD = True

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://'+env['USER']+':'+env['PASS']+'@localhost:'+env['PORT']+'/'+env['DB']
SQLACHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False

WTF_CSRF_ENABLED=True
SECRET_KEY='mysecretkey'
```

### `.env`
```python
FLASK_APP=app
FLASK_ENV=development
USER=your_username
PASS=your_password
PORT=5432
DB=your_database
```

---

## Migrations, migrations, migrations

Usually when we change something in our `models.py` we have to delete and recreate our database from scratch all over again. <br /> This is very inconvenient during development so we need a tool that will make the changes for us without deleting and recreating the entire database. 

That tool is `flask-migrate`. Let's install it;
> `(pyenv) pip install flask-migrate`

Now lets initialize our app for migrations;
```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_migrate import Migrate
from flask_admin import Admin
from app import raj

db = SQLAlchemy(raj)
migrate = Migrate(raj, db)
admin = Admin(raj)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return '<User %r>' % self.username
```


Once installed we have to follow the following step to get it setup;
1. `flask db init`
2. `flask db migrate`
3. *`flask db upgrade`

The last step is not necessary after the first `migration` but it is important after every subsequent `migration`. 

Once you have done that let us make some changes to our `models.py` to see if this will work.

If you remember, we created a food Item in part 2 [part 2]({% post_url 2019-09-10-part-2 %});
Let us add one thing; `image` and remove unique on everything else;

#### Updated `model.py`
```python
class FoodItem(db.Model):    
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)
    desc = db.Column(db.String(250), nullable=False)
    price = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
    image = db.Column(db.String(50))
    prep_time = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=True, nullable=False)
    #date = 

    def __repr__(self):
        return '<Food Item %r' % self.title

```

Now let us `migrate` and `upgrade`;
```
(pyenv) flask db migrate
(pyenv) flask db upgrade
```

If all went well then you should receive 0 errors.
Remeber to run those two commands everytime you change something in your models!
If you get any problems post them in the comment section below.

<h2 class="text-center"> Adding food images to our app </h2>

![Update2](/assets/img/pexels/raj_main_feature_part4.png)

### Where to find good images.

Go to [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com) and search fod food. You will find a lot of nice looking images. Download the ones you like and put them in your `/static/img/` folder.

### Adding the images

Let's modify our `FoodItem` model to include a string field for the image path;

```python
class FoodItem(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'food_item'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=True, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(80), nullable=False)
    desc = db.Column(db.String(250), unique=True, nullable=False)
    price = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
    prep_time = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)
    image = db.Column(db.String(250), index=True)
    date_added = db.Column(db.DateTime)
```

Let us migrate those changes; 
1. `$(pyenv) flask db migrate`
2. `$(pyenv) flask db upgrade`

Now run your app `$(pyenv) ./run.py` and navigate to `localhost:3000/admin/FoodItem` to begin adding items. For the image field just put the name of the image. For example, 
`burger.jpg` and do that for every food item you add. <br /> Make sure that every food item has an image with the file name of an image that actually exists in your `/static/img` folder.

### FrontEnd

Let's load the images into our home page.

First, import `FoodItem` from your `models` at the top of your `views.py`;
#### `app/views.py`
```python
...
from app.models import FoodItem
...
```
Then, update your `home` function in your views;
#### `app/views.py`
```python
@raj.route('/')
@raj.route('/home')
@raj.route('/index')
@templated()
def home():
    # user = g.user
    # food_items = app.Models.FoodItem
    return dict(title=app_name, user=user, dishes=FoodItem.query.all())
```

Now we can use dishes in `home.html`;
#### `app/templates/home.html`
```html
{% raw %}...
<div class="food-grid">
    {% for dish in dishes %}
    <div class="food-item">      
        <img src="{{ url_for( 'static', filename='img/' + dish.image ) }}" alt="" />
        <div class="food-box">
          <p><span>Dish #: </span> {{ dish.id }} </p>
          <a class="food-link" href="/add/{{ dish.id }}"> Add to tray </a>
        </div>
    </div>    
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
{% endraw %}...
```
<br/>

The images do load but they aren't responsive, i.e. they do not fit within our `menu-grid` system.<br/>For that, we need [responsify.js](https://github.com/wentin/ResponsifyJS). 
Download `responsify.js` and `responsify.min.js` into your `static/js/` folder. <br/>
Since both scripts use `jQuery` we need to download it as well, then we have to include all scripts at the bottom of our `base.html` like this;

#### `app/templates/base.html`
```html
...
    </main>
    <!-- JavaScripts -->    
    <script
        src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js"
        integrity="sha256-BbhdlvQf/xTY9gja0Dq3HiwQF8LaCRTXxZKRutelT44="
        crossorigin="anonymous">
     </script>
     <script src="static/js/responsify.js"></script>
     <script src="static/js/main.js"></script>
  </body>
  <!--body -->
...
```
Then we can use `responsify.js` in our `main.js` like so;
#### `app/static/js/main.js`
```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $(window.onload(function(){
        $('img').responsify();
    }));
    $(window).resize(function(){
        $('img').responsify();
    });
});
```

<br/>

### The `Tray` function

#### `app/views.py`
```python
@raj.route('/add/<int:dish>', methods=['GET','POST'])
def add():
    # associate this dish with the current user
    return redirect("previous URL")
```

What this function will do is associate the `current` user with the `FoodItem` id that was passed in. In order to do that we have to create a database `relationship` between the `User` and the `FoodItem`. <br />

We will do this in `part 5`<br/>
After making the association we will redirect the user to the previous `URL` and `flash` them a message stating that the item was added to the chart. 

What other things do we need to do? We need to define a checkout process. 

## Checkout!

Remeber that a user needs to be able to;
1. Add items onto a cart
2. See a complete break down of charges, including taxes 
3. Have the option to accept or cancel at any point before their card is charged
4. Be able to choose from a variety of payment options
5. Receive a receipt of the transaction

Let us try to implement some of these features;

### The `checkout` function
#### `app/views.py`
```python
...
@raj.route('/checkout')
def checkout():
    current_user = g.user
    subtotal = sum( g.user['tray'] )
    taxes = calc_tax( subtotal )
    total = subtotal + taxes
    return render_html('checkout.html', total=total, subtotal=subtotal, taxes=taxes)
...
```
`sum` calculates the total price of all the food items in the `current_user`'s tray. 
We will look at how the current user is determined later on. 
```python
...
def sum(tray):
    total = 0
    for dish in tray:
        total += dish.price
    return total
...
```

`calc_tax` calculates the amount of tax to be paid from the `subtotal` obtained previously
Then we calculate the total and send this information to the `checkout.html` template via three variables, `total`, `subtotal`, and `taxes`. 

### The `pay` function
This will be the second view the user will be presented with and immediately follows the `checkout` view, provided nothing goes wrong there. 

In `checkout.html` we will need to send the `total_price` to the `pay` route somehow;
```html {% raw %}
<a href="/pay/{{ total_price }}"> Accept </a>{% endraw %}
```

Now we can use the `total_price` to charge the user's card. 

#### `app/views.py`
```python
@raj.route('/pay/<float:total_price>')
def pay():
    # Choose a method of payment
    # PayPal
    # SquareCash
    # Visa/MasterCard
    # Venmo/Zelle/Other
    payment = verify( total_price )
    paycode = payment.code
    if payment.successful:
        receipt = generate_receipt( g.user['tray'], total_price )
        return render_template('payment_success.html', receipt=receipt, status_code=paycode)
    else:
        return render_template('payment_failure.html', status_code=paycode)
...
```

`verify` simply checks to see that the payment went through. 
We will see how to define this function in `part 5`but it should be clear what we expect from verify; an object with atleast the following members;
1. A status`code` # a code for describing the status of the verification
2. A `boolean` `successful` to indicate that the payment was successful. 

A status code is important for troubleshooting. Payments might fail for a variety of reasons;
- Customers might have insufficient funds in their account
- The banking services might be down due to maintainence e.t.c
- The user might have entered the wrong credentials
- Restaurant owner's bank might not accept funds from customer's bank
- e.t.c

A `status_code` that describes each problem mentioned above will make troubleshooting for both `customer` and `restaurant` owner much easier. 

`payment_succes.html` and `payment_failure.html` should be pretty straightforward templates to write. 


We shall complete the `checkout` part of our app in the next `post` until then,
happy coding :)

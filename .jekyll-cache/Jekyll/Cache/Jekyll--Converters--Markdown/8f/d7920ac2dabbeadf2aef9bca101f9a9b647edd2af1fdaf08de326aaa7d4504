<p>I was inspirired to do this project when I first started learning flask. 
I have the basic stuff working; I can fetch food items and their corresponding images from the app’s database.</p>

<p>I am open to suggestions. 
Ideas for a coupons page and a blog are also plausible. 
I thought I could use the app’s database for blog articles as well but worried it would be doing too much.</p>

<p>It doesn’t hurt to try though. It would also be fun experienting with another framwework, possibly nodejs, with regards to building a working blog.</p>

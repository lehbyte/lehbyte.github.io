I"Ø<p>I have been having an issue with my settings program not starting.
I would search for settings or look for it my list of apps and attempt to launch it. However, all I would get is a spinning wheel and then nothing. It would fail in the background without any warning or  error dialog. This is inherently bad design. Anyway I am kind of used to such shortcomings in open source software.</p>

<p>Curious about what was happening in the background, I fired up a bionic terminal and typed gnome-control-center and there it was, the error message meant for terminal-eyes only.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ERROR:../shell/cc-panel-list.c:926:cc_panel_list_set_active_panel: assertion failed: <span class="o">(</span>data <span class="o">!=</span> NULL<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">[</span>1] 7043 abort <span class="o">(</span>core dumped<span class="o">)</span> gnome-control-center
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It made little sense to me so I took the liberty of executing gnome-control-center
<code class="highlighter-rouge">$ gdb gnome-control-center</code> then followed by <code class="highlighter-rouge">run</code></p>

<p>This time I received some helpful information;</p>

<p>My best guess was that there was a corrupted thread running loose somewhere in the program.</p>

<p>So the best I could do was to force a reset of the gnome control center.</p>

I"{<p>This isn’t a rant. These are simply my thoughts on how you can become a better programmer. <br /> We all have goals, implicit or explicit that we strive to achieve. <br />
Sometimes we succeed, and other times we fall, we <code class="highlighter-rouge">fail</code>. <br /> And as with all things in life, it is important to learn from your mistakes.<br />
Becoming a better programmer is a balancing act between the 
abstract and the conrete parts of you as a programmer. 
Too much into one end and your stuck hunting down an invisible bug to the ends of the earth.</p>

<h1 id="balance-better">Balance better</h1>

<p>My tips on how to strike that balance;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Know where you are and I’m not talking about physical space.</li>
  <li>Do not waste time, every step should help you ascend, regardless of planning. For example;
    <ol>
      <li>Do not dwell on mundane tasks, automate them out of the way fast.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Exercise your fingers, your body, and your mind regularly.</li>
  <li>Learn how to learn.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope you find my list helpful/useful until then, happy coding.</p>

I"Š<p>I have been having an issue with my settings program not starting.
I would search for settings or look for it my list of apps and attempt to launch it. However, all I would get is a spinning wheel and then nothing. It would fail in the background without any warning or  error dialog. This is inherently bad design. Anyway I am kind of used to such shortcomings in open source software.</p>

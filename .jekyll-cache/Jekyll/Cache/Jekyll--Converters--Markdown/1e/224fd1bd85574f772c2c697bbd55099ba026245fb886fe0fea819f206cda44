I"C<p>Hi stranger;</p>

<p>Welcome to my blog. 
I actually started writting these articles on wordpress but I found their support of code highlighting wanting, and I was using it for free, so I decided to leave it in favor of github pages. Granted I won’t be able access site stats and the like but I think I am ok with that for the time being.</p>

<p>Here you’ll find articles on <code class="highlighter-rouge">flask</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">expressjs</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">python</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">c++</code> and so much more. 
Writing is still a learning process for me so feel free to point out any puncuation or grammatical errors you encounter while reading.</p>

<p>I love python, I think its power is in expression. It’s much more easier to express ideas in python, and it’s also easy to pick up. This is perhaps why I find django and flask easy frameworks to learn.</p>

<p>I ocassionally write articles about rails apps so if you’re a rails programmer I invite you to critique my work.</p>

<p>I hope you can find some use in these articles. Afterall, they are mostly a collection of tips and solutions to problems I continuously encounter in web development.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

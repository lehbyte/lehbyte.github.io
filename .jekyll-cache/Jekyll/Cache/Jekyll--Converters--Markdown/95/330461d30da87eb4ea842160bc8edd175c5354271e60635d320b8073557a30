I"@<p>This isnâ€™t a rant. These are simply my thoughts on how you can become a better programmer. <br /> We all have goals, implicit or explicit that we strive to achieve. <br />
Sometimes we succeed, and other times we fall, we <code class="highlighter-rouge">fail</code>. <br /> And as with all things in life, it is important to learn from your mistakes.<br />
Becoming a better programmer is a balancing act between the 
abstract and the conrete parts of you as a programmer. 
Too much into one end and your stuck hunting down an invisible bug to the ends of the earth.</p>

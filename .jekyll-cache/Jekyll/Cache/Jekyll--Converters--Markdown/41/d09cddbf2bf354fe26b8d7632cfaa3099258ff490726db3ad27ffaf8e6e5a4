I"8<p>I’m still working on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">raj</code> restaurant app and will be posting details soon on the progress I’ve made thus far. <br /> Briefly, I have made some neat changes on the frontend and some minor changes on the models which is where I’m stuck at the moment. <br /> For those following these posts, you may have found yourself in a similar situation. I’m working on a solution to fix migration errors that usually result from typos/mistakes on the programmer’s part. <br />
With that, let’s dive into today’s post.</p>

<p>I recently upgraded my <code class="highlighter-rouge">Waterfox</code> version. I first had to close down all running instances of Waterfox, and delete it from 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/lib/</code>. I then downloaded the classic version of it and extracted it to my <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/lib/</code> directory and hoped that everything would work fine but I was wrong. For some reason <code class="highlighter-rouge">Waterfox</code> would not launch when I clicked the icon so I popped open a terminal and navigated to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/lib/waterfox-classic</code> to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">waterfox</code>. 
Thats when I got the error: <code class="highlighter-rouge">can not load XPCOM.</code></p>

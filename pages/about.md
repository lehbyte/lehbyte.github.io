Hi stranger;

Welcome to my blog. 
I actually started writting these articles on wordpress but I found their support of code highlighting wanting, and I was using it for free, so I decided to leave it in favor of github pages. Granted I won't be able access site stats and the like but I think I am ok with that for the time being. 

Here you'll find articles on `flask`, `expressjs`, `python`, `c++` and so much more. 
Writing is still a learning process for me so feel free to point out any puncuation or grammatical errors you encounter while reading. 

I love python, I think its power is in expression. It's much more easier to express ideas in python, and it's also easy to pick up. This is perhaps why I find django and flask easy frameworks to learn. 

I ocassionally write articles about rails apps so if you're a rails programmer I invite you to critique my work. 

I hope you can find some use in these articles. Afterall, they are mostly a collection of tips and solutions to problems I continuously encounter in web development. 

Happy coding!
